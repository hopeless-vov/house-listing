# house-listing (Vuejs project)

The project was created as a test task.
The goal of this task is to create a project that displays a list of homes for sale.
All the homes I am getting using API.
The user can view the list of houses, use search and filters in order to quickly find a house that suits him.
The user can also put his house up for sale by filling in all the necessary information. After the user has put his house up for sale, he can edit the data he entered.
